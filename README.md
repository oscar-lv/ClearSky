#Web App created for HackCity 2018

This is the interface for a web-app aiming to help urban planners and cities optimize spaces around airports which are often noisy and polluted. 

This code shows the front end which links back to a Django/Python server in order to display cross-referenced information about present planes and their pollution (noise and air). 

Message me if you have any questions.
